  <p>You must book your first session within 30 days of the assignment, or these hours will expire, and your status will
    change to inactive.</p>

  <h3>Hereâ€™s how to book your session:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Find your advisor.</strong> <span
      th:text="#{email.applications.business.owner.assign.advisor.body5(${portalName})}"></span></li>
    <li><strong>Schedule.</strong> Easily book a time for your first 1-hour advisor session. The first session is always
      an informational consultation. Be prepared to discuss all your needs so your consultant can build a scope to
      deliver work for you.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Confirm your session.</strong> Once you've answered a few booking questions, you'll be prompted to
      finalize your appointment on the booking screen. You will receive a confirmation email with a virtual meeting
      link, calendar invite, and booking details.
    </li>
  </ol>
